description: "Table-Talk is a collection of essays by the English cultural critic\
  \ and social commentator William Hazlitt. It was originally published as two volumes,\
  \ the first of which appeared in April 1821. The essays deal with topics such as\
  \ art, literature and philosophy. Duncan Wu has described the essays as the \"pinnacle\
  \ of [Hazlitt's] achievement\", and argues that Table-Talk and The Plain Speaker\
  \ (1826) represent Hazlitt's masterpiece.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
